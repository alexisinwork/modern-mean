# Todo app

Todo app using MEAN stack with modern versions of Mongo, Express, Angular 2, Node.
I tired of waiting for somebody nice to freely implement ready solution for all who interested in MEAN stack nowadays.
So I tried to experiment with new stack and try everything that needed for application.
Todo app can be a little bit overwhelming, but it is because I want to try everything that needed for real apps.
